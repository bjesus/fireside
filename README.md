# ðŸ”¥ Fireside
Fireside is a stylesheet for Firefox that provides you with a clean UI. Less clutter, more vertical space.

## Features
- Vertical tabs (using ~[Tab Center Reborn](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabcenter-reborn/) or [Sidebery](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery/)~ Firefox's native Vertical Tabs support)
- Zero UI elements taking vertical space
- Auto-collapsing sidebar and address bar preserving horizontal space and removing distraction
- Keyboard and mouse support

## Tested with

## Installation
1. Go to `about:config` and set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`
2. Enable Vertical Tabs and choose "Expand sidebar on hover" in the "Customize sidebar" panel
3. In your Firefox Profile Directory (see `about:support` if you're not sure where it is) create a `chrome` directory and place the [userChrome.css](userChrome.css) file inside
4. Restart Firefox

## Usage
- Open the sidebar either using the mouse or by focusing on the location bar with `Ctrl+L`
- Back, Forward, Refresh, and other useless buttons were removed. Use touch gestures (two fingers slide), keyboard (`Alt+Left`, `Alt+Right`, `Ctrl+R`), or right click instead
